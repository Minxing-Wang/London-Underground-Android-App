###Description 

This is the final project of my CPSC 210 (Software Construction) class. This was a app for the London Underground Transport where this app would display the routes and stations of the subway. We were responsible to implement the classes under MindTheGap_Phase2_Stater_15W1/src/ca/ubc/cs/cpsc210/mindthegap

Some features we were responsible for were getting the time for arrivals for the station, adding parsed stations to line, adding stations to lines and lines to stations, parsing real time information from the London Underground website, adding the stations and lines onto the map and locating the closest station to the person.
